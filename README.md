# Work Day Scheduler

For this assignment we were given some basic HTML and CSS starter code and were tasked with adding the JavaScript and jQuery elements to this to make it in to a functional scheduler. I added in a current time element so that you can see the current date as well as a functional clock to see the seconds. On top of that, the times are color coded so that you can see when an assigment is coming up, due, and past due. I also added in a function that saved the text in text area to the local storage so that the user could change the data in there when they want to update/ clear it.  The issue that I ran in to here was not being able to get the coloring to stick within the text area spot and getting the border to work.
